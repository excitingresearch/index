The [Exciting Research](https://excitingresearch.io/) is an ongoing research about the excitement-measurements collected and visualized by a device MOODYÂ® intending to make the third upgrade hanging on the ear, a jewel/ earring. It shows the individual excitements of the people by measuring the temperature of the ear. And by measuring distances between each other, it will give us data to visualize the 'Energies between People'.
